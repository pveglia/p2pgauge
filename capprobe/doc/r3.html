Traditionally (RFC1349), these have been interpreted as: 0 for reserved

Possible settings for Type of Service are: minimal cost: 0x02, 
reliability: 0x04, throughput: 0x08, low delay: 0x10.  Multiple TOS bits
should not be set simultaneously.  Possible settings for
special Precedence range from priority (0x20) to net control (0xe0).  You
must be root (<CODE

higher precedence value.  You cannot set
bit 0x01 (reserved) unless ECN has been enabled in the kernel.
In RFC2474, these fields has been redefined as 8-bit Differentiated

here), and bits 2-7 of Differentiated Services Codepoint (DSCP).

Duplicate packets should never occur, and seem to be caused by
inappropriate link-level retransmissions.
Duplicates may occur in many situations and are rarely (if ever) a
good sign, although the presence of low levels of duplicates may not
always be cause for alarm.</P

>TRYING DIFFERENT DATA PATTERNS</H2
><P
>The (inter)network layer should never treat packets differently depending
on the data contained in the data portion.
Unfortunately, data-dependent problems have been known to sneak into
networks and remain undetected for long periods of time.
In many cases the particular pattern that will have problems is something
that doesn't have sufficient ``transitions'', such as all ones or all
zeros, or a pattern right at the edge, such as almost all zeros.
It isn't necessarily enough to specify a data pattern of all zeros (for
example) on the command line because the pattern that is of interest is
at the data link level, and the relationship between what you type and
what the controllers transmit can be complicated.</P
><P
>This means that if you have a data-dependent problem you will probably
have to do a lot of testing to find it.
If you are lucky, you may manage to find a file that either can't be sent
across your network or that takes much longer to transfer than other
similar length files.
You can then examine this file for repeated patterns that you can test
using the <CODE

packets should be set to 60, but many systems use smaller values
