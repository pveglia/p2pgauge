1. the file kiviat.py produces the kiviat.??.gp where ?? is generally a number

2. it reads the configuration from the file kiviat.conf which is a list of
   
	...
    axis_conf_file curves_conf_file.??
    ...

	so kiviat.py produces a gp for every line of the file

3.  the axis_conf_file contains the list of the axes of the kiviat in the format:  

	...
	PARAM LABEL MAX
    ...

	where 
    - PARAM is the name of the parameter which will be searched in kiviat.DATA
    - LABEL will be the label in the graph
    - MAX is the maximum value of the axis, which is also represented on the picture

4. the curves_conf_file contains the list of the curves to be represented

   ...
   CURVELABEL
   ...

	where LABEL is the name of the curve

5. data for the graph is read from kiviat.DATA which is in the format
   
   [PARAM]_[CURVELABEL] value

	where 
    - PARAM is the same as the PARAM in the axis_conf_file
    - CURVELABEL is the same as the CURVELABEL in the curves_conf_file
    - VALUE is the value to represent
